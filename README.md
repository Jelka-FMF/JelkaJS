# Jelka JavaScript API

JavaScript API for Jelka FMF patterns.

## Note

If you want to contribute your own Jelka FMF patterns, you should check out the
[Storži](https://github.com/Jelka-FMF/Storzi) repository for full instructions
about developing and contributing patterns.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not know how to use Git/GitHub or cannot follow these instructions
> for any other reason, you can instead check out [Jelkly](https://jelkly.fmf.uni-lj.si/docs).
> It provides Scratch-like visual programming tool for creating and submitting
> your own Jelka FMF patterns, without requiring any programming knowledge.
> It is based on the same API as this repository, but provides a visual
> drag-and-drop interface for creating patterns.

## Documentation

The documentation is currently in development. You can check out the source code
for more information and Storži repository for existing patterns.
